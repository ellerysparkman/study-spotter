Also included in the [Getting Started](https://study-spotter-b578efeb4b3d.herokuapp.com/getting-started/) page on the application:
* Right click on the map to add a location.
* After filling out the form to add a location, your request will be sent for admin approval.
* Your request will either be:
  * _Pending_: Until an admin approves or rejects the location, a yellow marker will appear on the map that only you and all administrators can see.
  * _Accepted_: Congrats, your study spot will appear on the map as a blue marker to you, the creator, but as a red marker to other users.
  * _Rejected_: Your study spot will not appear on the map

* Click on a marker on the map to read a brief description about that study spot.
* A marker can only be edited or deleted by its creator or the administrators.
* Click on the arrow on the left side of the map to open a sidebar. This gives you the ability to:
  * Use the searchbar at the top to find locations identified by Google Maps.
  * Filter by locations with food.
  * Identify markers on the map by clicking on the item in the list.
  * Click on the star corresponding to each location in the sidebar to add it to your Starred Locations list, which you can access through "My Study Spots."
* Go to "My Study Spots" on the nav bar to view all the locations you've submitted (including rejected markers) and locations you've starred/favorited.

For admin users only:
* See the Pending Locations in the nav bar to keep track of incoming Study Spot requests
* Either "accept" or "reject" a study spot. When rejecting a location, please provide a reason.
